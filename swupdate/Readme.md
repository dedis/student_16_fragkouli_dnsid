This is basically a complete copy of the cosi protocol (created by 
@nikkolasg) with some nice additional features (possibility to pass the 
message directly in the Announcement and the possibility to validate 
this data in a general way). 
This shouldn't be merged into master as it is. All changes (which are 
useful) should most probably directly go into the main cosi 
implementation in the cosi repository.
